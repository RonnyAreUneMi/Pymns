   abstract = {The fastest-developed computer language around the world is python because it is easy to use. Most of the linear regression methods currently used for traffic prediction cannot explain the accuracy differences between methods. In this study, the idea of constructing a regression model, decision tree regressor, and random forest regressor is described by analyzing the sales volume, region, and time of a take-out company, and the accuracy difference between the three different models with the same data is compared. It is concluded that the random forest regression volume has the highest accuracy among the three, and the results are obtained by bringing them into the original data for experiments. Although the linear regression model improves the scientific and rational nature of logistics forecasting. It provides a decision basis for enterprises to forecast sales volume. However, if only the linear regression model is used for forecasting, it is still not accurate enough. It needs to be combined with other methods for experiments to further improve accuracy, scientificity, and rationality. In the paper, the basic knowledge of statistics is used to create three different linear regressions through python and find which one is the most accurate. R2 score, MSE, and RMSE are explained. Based on the study, when firms do the prediction of their business or any other projects, if the data set have the linear regression relationship, they could choose the Random Forest through python directly as it is the most precise among them.},

   abstract = {As a complex hot problem in the financial field, stock trend forecasting uses a large amount of data and many related indicators; hence it is difficult to obtain sustainable and effective results only by relying on empirical analysis. Researchers in the field of machine learning have proved that random forest can form better judgements on this kind of problem, and it has an auxiliary role in the prediction of stock trend. This study uses historical trading data of four listed companies in the USA stock market, and the purpose of this study is to improve the performance of random forest model in medium- and long-term stock trend prediction. This study applies the exponential smoothing method to process the initial data, calculates the relevant technical indicators as the characteristics to be selected, and proposes the D-RF-RS method to optimize random forest. As the random forest is an ensemble learning model and is closely related to decision tree, D-RF-RS method uses a decision tree to screen the importance of features, and obtains the effective strong feature set of the model as input. Then, the parameter combination of the model is optimized through random parameter search. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of random forest is increased by 0.17 after the above process optimization, which is 0.18 higher than the average accuracy of light gradient boosting machine model. Combined with the performance of the ROC curve and Precisionâ€“Recall curve, the stability of the model is also guaranteed, which further demonstrates the advantages of random forest in medium- and long-term trend prediction of the stock market.},

   abstract = {The Smart Home Energy Management System (SHEMS) presents an innovative solution for optimizing energy consumption in residential settings by harnessing the synergy between Internet of Things (IoT) technology and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. SHEMS offers a comprehensive suite of functionalities including monitoring, controlling, and optimizing energy usage while identifying wastage within smart homes. Its architecture comprises IoT sensors for data acquisition, an IoT gateway for preprocessing and storing data, and an Energy Management System (EMS) empowered by ML infrastructure for feature extraction and data transformation. Notably, the incorporation of the Gradient Boosting (GB) mechanism imbues SHEMS with intelligence, enabling it to analyze intricate datasets, detect patterns, and make data-driven decisions regarding energy optimization. Through ML capabilities, SHEMS adapts to dynamic usage patterns, predicts future consumption trends, and identifies opportunities for energy savings. Facilitating seamless data flow from sensors to the EMS, advanced ML techniques drive intelligent decision-making for enhanced energy efficiency. Additionally, SHEMS provides users with actionable insights and user-friendly interfaces for informed energy management, promising significant improvements in energy efficiency, cost reduction, and sustainability. The results showcase the effectiveness of the Gradient Boosting (GB) algorithm in predicting energy consumption for smart homes, with a score of 0.95, RMSE of 6.8, and MAE of 5.2. The Gradient Boosting algorithm consistently outperforms other ML algorithms, including Simple Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, K-nearest neighbor Regression, and Support Vector Machine Regression.},
